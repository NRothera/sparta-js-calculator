## Good things

> Everything works, math seems to be correct and the indentation is correct

## Bad things

> Unfortunately I got a bit stuck finding out a way to check in the inputs were integers, floats and over 0. I could seem to get one or the other but eventually it started getting a bit complicated and I decided to stick to the basic task!
